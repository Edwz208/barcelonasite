  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona"> <img src="/images/barcelonalogo.png" id="logo2"></a><p id ="greatestparagraph1">The club has had multiple lineups that can be considered the greatest team of all time in terms of both success and playstyle.<br><br>The Pep Guardiola era: In the 2000s, FC Barcelona was led by former player Pep Guardiola, who became the team's coach in 2008. Guardiola perfected the tiki-taka style of play, using short passes and quick movement to dominate possession and create scoring opportunities. Under Guardiola's guidance, the team won an unprecedented six trophies in one calendar year (2008/2009) and played some of the most beautiful and dominant football in the history of the sport. The 2009 team featured Victor Valdes, Dani Alves, Gerard Pique, Carles Puyol (Captain), Eric Abidal, Sergio Busquets, Lionel Messi,  Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta, Thierry Henry, and Samuel Eto'o. <br><br>The MSN era: The Messi-Suarez-Neymar trio terrorized clubs for 3 seasons between 2014 and 2017, and was known for their incredible skill, understanding, and chemistry on the pitch. The trio was an instant success, netting 122 goals in the 2014/15 season across all competitions.It was Barcelonaâ€™s most successful season since 2008/09 and they became the only European team to lift a continental treble twice.</p>
