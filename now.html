  <h1 id = "headernow">Nowadays</h1><p id = "nowparagraph1">FC Barcelona has faced several struggles in recent years, both on and off the field. The team has declined in performance, failing to maintain its dominance in Spanish and European football. The club's financial situation has been a cause for concern, with mounting debt and the COVID-19 pandemic contributing to a challenging financial environment. The club has also been embroiled in a number of controversies related to its management and leadership, including the arrest of former president Josep Maria Bartomeu on charges of corruption. 
<br><br>Despite all this, the team has been reconstructing its team by partnering with Spotify and selling TV rights. Since 2022, with the new flow of money, Barcelona has completely revamped the roster, adding quality players such as Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha,Jules Koundé, João Cancelo, İlkay Gündoğan, Alejandro Balde, João Félix, Vitor Roque, and Fermin López. Although they have yet to prove successful in Europe, Barcelona has a promising future with Hansi Flick being the coach for the upcoming 2024-25 season and talented youth.
